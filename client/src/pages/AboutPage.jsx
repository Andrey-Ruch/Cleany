          Cleanliness and order are crucial for a high quality of life, but
          finding cleaning staff is a tedious process. The methods for finding
          work or employees in this field are outdated and based on luck or it's
          a matter of whether you know someone or not.
          <br />
          <br />
          "Cleany" connects employers and cleaners in a focused way. The
          interface will allow an equal search process for both sides, providing
          solutions for finding workers for both short-notice jobs and
          longer-term duties.
